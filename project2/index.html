        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="log.png" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Map of U.S. states showing excessive abortion numbers across the nation.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Aggresive title</i>, <b>score: -0.5</b>. The title immediately conveys the tone of the visualization and what the intented message is.
            I think this title works well since it is simple, not too complicated, yet feels powerful and grabs the reader's attention.
            I chose this title because one of the biggest arguments against abortion is that it should be considered murder, so I decided to
            lean into that narrative. It's obviously trying to persuade, but it doesn't do anything too deceptive.
          <li>
            <i>Use of red color scheme</i>, <b>score: -0.5</b>. Pairing red with the murder-themed title was intented to make the reader imagine much
            death across the nation, to emphasize the harm abortions are doing. Even though this isn't skewing any data, it's still attempting
            to bring some kind of reaction out of the reader.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Logged scales</i>, <b>score: -2</b>. This is arguably the most deceptive design in the entire visualization. The total number of abortions
            in each state were scaled logarithmically which compresses the extremely large values down to the level of the low to average values.
            This makes the data seem much less spread out, even though there are only a states values truly dominate the leaderboard. The logged
            scaling was done to show the reader that abortions are prevelant in almost all 50 U.S. states, "proving" to be a serious cause of concern.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Altered color bar title and tickmarks</i>, <b>score: -2</b>. This design is almost just as deceptive as the one aboves as it hides the fact that
            these values were put through a logarithmic function and yet makes it seem like the states are colored using the absolute abortion numbers.
            The design here is incredibly deceptive and was done to make it appear as though most states havehundreds of thousands of abortions
            when in reality, that simply isn't true.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Unmentioned aggregation of Maryland and Washington D.C. data</i>, <b>score: -1.5</b>. This was only so the data could be mapped correctly
            since Washington D.C. is not able to be shown on Plotly's choropleth maps, however it also has bigger implications, since it is explicitly
            pointed out in the annotations. The D.C. capitol has an alarming number of abortions, so even when combined with Maryland's abortion data,
            it's still an outlier in terms of it's number of abortions considering its size. This was done to try to convince the reader that smaller
            states also have higher abortion numbers. Additionally, it should be pointed out that the annotation says 86th percentile which still hides
            the absolute number of abortions since it's the 86th percentile of log-scaled values, making it appear more extreme than it really is.

        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

          <figcaption>Map of U.S. states showing unequal distribution in abortions numbers across the nation.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Use of green color scheme</i>, <b>score: 1.5</b>. I think the color selection here is somewhat neutral, compared to other design decisions.
            The idea was to avoid evoking a sense of warning or alert that there is a problem, contrasting the opposing visualization. I don't
            think it's necessarily deceptive, but I can't say it's completely earnest as there were persuasive intentions involved.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Unmentioned aggregation of Maryland and Washington D.C. data</i>, <b>score: 1</b>. This was only done so the data could be mapped correctly
            since Washington D.C. is not able to be shown on Plotly's choropleth maps. This didn't have much of an impact on the visualization, but it
            was never mentioned to the reader, so I think a 1 is fair. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <i>Top 5 states annotations</i>, <b>score: 1.5</b>. There is no real deception taking place here, since those percentages are completely correct,
            however the fact that it is being explicitly pointed out to the reader, implies persuasive motives exist. The most persuasive part was the
            text box stating that the top 5 states make up close to 50% of all abortions. While true, its aim was to suggest to the reader that the
            abortion problem isn't nationwide, but only in a few states. This worked well as the lines, marks, and annotations came out cleanly, effectively
            communicating the corresponding storyline. The only issue was that in the Plotly figure, if I panned around the image, the annotations stay
            stuck in place and don't move with the map. Since the image above is static, however, this isn't much of an issue.

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>
          The overall process was much more complicated than anticipated which is surprising considering I felt the same way about Project 1. It's really easy
          to underestimate how difficult the process is when you see previous examples. Seeing past visualizations makes the task seem much easier because
          once you see it all put together, the takeaway appears obvious. In reality, however, when starting this project and having multiple columns to choose
          from to make contrasting visualizations, the number of possibilities can be overwhelming.
          <br>
          I thought that making a map would be the most effective strategy seeing that all the data was grouped based on a state level, but the hard part was
          choosing which metric(s) to use and how to make the same column of data argue against itself. Total number of abortions made the most sense since it
          was an easy metric to conceptualize and it was one of the few columns in which no states had missing values for. Making the less-deceptive map was
          pretty straightforward, but making the deceptive one was much harder. It surprisingly took me a while to think of using the logged values for the
          number of abortions, but once I calculated those values, it was pretty easy from there. The most time consuming designs were making the style look
          nice and adding tedious annotations, but in the end, it was definitely worth it.
          <br>
          I would define ethical analysis as making your visualization clear so that someone who isn't data literate doesn't have to think about any hidden tricks
          being used. This means not scaling the data in a confusing way and/or scaling without informing the reader, ensuring all axes follow the average reader's
          intuition, and making the visualization look easy on the eyes, so the reader doesn't have to do a lot of cognitive work. I think there is a major difference
          between being persuasive and being deceptive. I'm all for adding color, forming creative titles, and pointing out interesting observations from the data, but
          the line is drawn at skewing data and intentionally misinforming readers for the sake of leading them on to a specific narrative.
